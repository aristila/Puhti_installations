How to make Passim work on Puhti

I first tried using these instructions as the basis: 
  https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/detecting-text-reuse-with-passim#linux-instructions 
but it is outdated and it's better to just follow the GitHub instructions:
  https://github.com/dasmiq/passim

Step 1) JAVA
Checking the Java version on the login node is not enough, since the version on the actual computing node will not be the same. 
However, just loading module "biojava" in your script should be enough to ensure the correct versoin. For example:
  module load biojava/1.8
after which Passim wants JAVAHOME variable defined, so that can be done with:
  export JAVA_HOME=/appl/soft/bio/java/openjdk/jdk8u312-b07 
(these two lines of code were direct instructions for me from helpdesk; if someone knows how to find out the exact path for any java module, contribute here or let me know in some other way)
Check java with:
  java -version
in your batch script.

Step 2) APACHE SPARK
[under construction]
[possibly use this version https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.1.2/ ]

Step 3) INSTALL PASSIM
Follow GitHub instructions: 
  https://github.com/dasmiq/passim

Step 4) TWEAKING THE BATCH JOB
[direct instructions from CSC servicedesk:]
You should be able to adjust the number of parallel workers with the "local[N]" setting to SPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS:
  export SPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS="--master local[10]"
