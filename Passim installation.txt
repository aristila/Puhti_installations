How to make Passim work on Puhti

((!These instructions are outdated: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/detecting-text-reuse-with-passim
here is the updated version: https://github.com/dasmiq/ph-submissions/blob/passim2-replace/en/published/originals/detecting-text-reuse-with-passim.md))

Step 1) JAVA
Checking the Java version on the login node is not enough, since the version on the actual computing node will not be the same. 
However, just loading module "biojava" in your script should be enough to ensure the correct version. For example:
  module load biojava/1.8
after which Passim wants JAVAHOME variable defined, which can be done with the following line:
  export JAVA_HOME=/appl/soft/bio/java/openjdk/jdk8u312-b07 
(these two lines of code were direct instructions for me from servicedesk; if someone knows how to find out the exact path for any java module, contribute here or let me know in some other way)
Check java with:
  java -version
in your batch script.

Step 2) APACHE SPARK
There should be no need to install Spark separately if you loaded the two modules mentioned above.
After loading the modules you can check Spark version with:
  pyspark --version
For me it says Spark is version 3.5.0

Step 3) INSTALL PASSIM
Follow GitHub instructions: 
  https://github.com/dasmiq/passim
NB! By default Passim installs itself in your home directory. 
if you do not want that, create a venv or something.

Step 4) TWEAKING THE BATCH JOB
a)
You should be able to adjust the number of parallel workers with the "local[N]" setting to SPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS.
Similarly, adjust the memory usage limits. I used a line like this to run passimP
  SPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS='--master local[4] --driver-memory 8G --executor-memory 4G' passim path/to/input path/to/output
b)
[instructions from CSC servicedesk:]
Any larger datasets than a small test will probably give an error "No space left on device". Avoid this by using $LOCAL_SCRATCH or giving it some other path to use as a temporary directory: 
  export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.io.tmpdir=$LOCAL_SCRATCH/tmp"
Passim will try to create the directory, so giving it just "$LOCAL_SCRATCH" will end up in an error.

Good luck!
