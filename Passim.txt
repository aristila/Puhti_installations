How to make Passim work on Puhti

(Using these instructions as the basis: 
  https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/detecting-text-reuse-with-passim#linux-instructions )

Step 1)
Check java with:
  java -version
It should be 1.8.0_252 or similar starting with 1.8.0.

Step 2)
Download and unpack sbt from here (I used version 1.9.7): 
  https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/
to your project's projappl partition (not scratch!).
NB! The way to install sbt described in the Programming Historian's instructions doesn't work! 

Step 3)
Download and unpack Spark from here:
  https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.1.2/ 
NB! The address given by Programming Historian doesn't work

Step 4)
Add permanently to path by opening .bashrc with e.g. nano:
  nano ~/.bashrc
and then adding these lines to the end of the file (check that they point to correct folders):
  export PATH="/projappl/<project_number>/sbt/bin:$PATH"
  export PATH="/projappl/<project_number>/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop2.7/bin:$PATH"
  export PATH="/projappl/<project_number>/Passim/bin:$PATH"
and finally update bashrc:
  source ~/.bashrc

Step 5)
Check that Passim works with:
  passim --help
